    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Space Race</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and classes. I created two classes for each rockets, 
        which dont really look like rockets rather bigger circles, anyways the idea of the game 
        is that the players should basically try to reach the end by avoiding the debris 
        by using the "w" and "s" key or the "up" and "down" arrow keys. i created anothe class for 
        the debris and called each of them in the main setup. Figuring out the collision detection was
        a real challenge but with help from my colleagues i figured it out.
