      <p> Add some information about yourself. For now we're happy to know anything you're
      willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Space Race</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and classes. I created two classes for each rockets, 
        which dont really look like rockets rather bigger circles, anyways the idea of the game 
        is that the players should basically try to reach the end by avoiding the debris 
        by using the "w" and "s" key or the "up" and "down" arrow keys. i created anothe class for 
        the debris and called each of them in the main setup. Figuring out the collision detection was
        a real challenge but with help from my colleagues i figured it out.
